# Self Evaluation

- This final CFU encompassed everything you've learned in Mod 0, and maybe even required some learning outside of what you've explicitly been taught. How did it feel as you faced these challenges?

Honestly it was quite confusing trying to add on classes into what ive learned so far. I am honestly not quite sure if i did it correctly or not

- How is your workflow going, in terms of taking breaks, staying focused, etc.?

so far my workflow has been decent, I have been taking breaks every hour or so, and making sure that I am focused on the task at hand when I am working

- What do you need to do to be ready for intense technical lessons and challenges like this, for 6 hours/day next week? What support do you need?

Just to make sure that the work that I did today was correctly done, and if not how do i rectify it
